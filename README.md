The main file, index.html, contains the webpage that the user interacts with

//BASICS//
This file helps users to generate passwords from any length between 8-32 characters. 
This project has mainly Front-end development, all made in HTML and JavaScript. 
We do not save passwords because we value privacy, the program can only generate new passwords (old passwords will be deleted).

//HOW TO USE//
The basic features of the password-generator has 4 sections: checkboxes, sliders, textbox (with the generated password) and buttons.
	- CHECKBOX: The checkboxse include 4 categories: Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers and Symbols
	- SLIDERS: (not the ones from White Castles or Arby's, unfortunately) A slider that lets you set the length of the passwordfrom 8-32 characters.
	- TEXTBOX: A textbox right under the slider that displays the currently generated passwords. Once a new password is generated, the old one will be deleted.
	- BUTTONS: There are two main buttons: Generate, Regenerate. Generate creates a password, while Regenerate creates a new password with the ticked checkbox parameters.
